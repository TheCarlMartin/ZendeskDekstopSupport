# Desktop Support
The purpose of this app is to simplify access to internal Help Desk resources from Zendesk.

Current Features include:
* Zendesk OAuth authentication
* Search Help Center first, before creating a new ticket.
* Creating a new ticket without having the user reenter any personal information like name or email
* Overview of recent tickets
* See comment history
* Add new comments to tickets

Planned Features include:
* Desktop Notification, when new comments are added to a ticket

I'm building this app for a small business on my personal time to learn Web Technologies and the Electron Framework.
