# ZendeskDesktopSupport
I'm developing this app to learn JavaScript.
I'm building this app on top of the electron framework.

This app will allow the employees of a small business access a Zendesk Help Center and submit tickets directly from their desktops.

#Stored Items
- Zendesk OAuth token ('code')
- Stay Signed in decision ('staySignedIn')

Add method that deletes token, when Window is closed, if user didn't select stay signed in.
