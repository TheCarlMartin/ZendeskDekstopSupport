# Zendesk Desktop Client

I like to learn Hands-on. So when I wanted to learn JavaScript, HTML and CSS I decided to build a simple Desktop Client for Zendesk that uses the Zendesk API, OAuth and JQuery. Having learned so much now, looking back on this it's clear that a Single-Page Framework would work a lot better than JQuery and that a complete rebuild is necessary.

The purpose of this app is to simplify access to internal Help Desk resources from Zendesk.

Current Features include:
* Zendesk OAuth authentication
* Search Help Center first, before creating a new ticket.
* Creating a new ticket without having the user reenter any personal information like name or email
* Overview of recent tickets
* See comment history
* Add new comments to tickets
* Desktop Notification, when new comments are added to a ticket
